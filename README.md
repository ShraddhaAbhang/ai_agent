# AI Agents

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of AI agents designed to automate tasks and make intelligent decisions in various domains. The agents are built using advanced machine learning and AI algorithms, and they aim to solve specific problems effectively.

## Features

- **Intelligent Decision Making**: The agents can learn and adapt to new information to make better decisions.
- **Task Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks, saving time and increasing productivity.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Some agents are capable of processing and understanding human language to      interact more naturally with users.
- **Machine Learning**: The agents use machine learning models to predict outcomes and learn from past experiences.
- **Customizability**: Modify the agents to suit specific requirements or integrate them into existing systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for building the agents.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for building and training models.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Libraries like `spaCy` and `NLTK` for text processing and understanding.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for training models and making predictions.
- **OpenAI API (if applicable)**: For integrating advanced language models.

## Installation

To get started with the AI agents, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShraddhaAbhang/ai_agent.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ai-agents
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure your environment (if necessary):
   - For OpenAI agents, create an API key and set it in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
   - Modify any configuration files for specific agents.

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can interact with the AI agents.

### Running an Agent
To run an agent, use the following command:
```bash
python agent.py
```


### Customization
To modify the behavior of an agent, you can:
- Edit the agent's configuration files.
- Update the agentâ€™s model parameters in the code.
- Add additional training data for more accurate predictions.
